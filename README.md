This competition is very straightforward. Your task is to class a piece of text into either positive or negative class. However, there is no fixed definition for the positive and the negative classes.

For example, "the plastic doesn't feel to comfortable but it's not bad, the light weight makes up for it." is a positive class. There is mixed expression in the sentence but you can guess that the writer ended the statement on a slightly good note.

You are encouraged to study the text and carry out some analysis to help you build a good-performing classifier.
